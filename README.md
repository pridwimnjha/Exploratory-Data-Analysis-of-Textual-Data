Exploratory Data Analysis of Textual Data

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for **Natural Language Processing Lab** , focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of textual data**.

The experiment involves analyzing textual datasets to extract insights such as word frequency distributions, n-grams, character mentions, and sentiment-related patterns. It also demonstrates how EDA acts as a foundation for **Sentiment Analysis** and other NLP tasks.

## 🎯 Aim

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** on text data.
* Extract most frequent words, phrases (bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams).
* Identify key **characters, places, and events** from novels.
* Visualize insights using **word clouds, histograms, and bar plots**.
* Perform EDA on a real-world **review dataset** (books/products/hotels).

---

## 📂 Contents

* **`NLP_EDA.ipynb`** → Jupyter Notebook with code implementation.
* **Sample Datasets**:

  * *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen
  * *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville
  * Hypothetical book reviews dataset

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas` – Data handling
  * `nltk` – Tokenization, stopwords, n-grams
  * `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Visualization
  * `wordcloud` – Word cloud generation
  * `plotly` – Interactive plots

---

## 📊 Key Results

Dataset Analysis (Book Reviews)

* Rating distributions and review lengths analyzed.
* Word clouds for **positive vs negative reviews** highlight contrasting sentiments.
* Formulated problem statement: *Predict book ratings from review text using sentiment analysis.*

---

## 📖 Learning & Observations

* **Observation**: Raw textual data reveals stylistic and thematic differences across novels.
* **Learning**: EDA provides essential insights before applying NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or classification.
